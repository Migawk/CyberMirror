My own 'Magic Mirror' for a tablet.
Originally used for Galaxy Tab 3.

Maybe translated to Swedish / Ukrainian in the future.
Written in Kotlin, ktor and some additional small libs for serialization.

Look config files before you compile it. You need WeatherApi/ExchangerApi keys, encoded city names, maybe something else idk.
