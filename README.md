My own Magic Mirror for a tablet.

Originally used for Galaxy Tab 3.

Currently news unavailable due to most of Swedish news missing API.
I don't want to write parsers and get news by this way, because it may break rules of using and something like this.

Maybe translated to Swedish / Ukrainian in the future.
Written in Kotlin, ktor and some additional small libs for serialization.

Look config files before you compile it. You need WeatherApi/ExchangerApi keys, encoded city names, maybe something else idk.
